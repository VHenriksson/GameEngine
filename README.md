# GameEngine

A simple game engine used to create a game inspired by Snake, but on a 3D-sphere. The engine uses OpenGL and SDL and relies on Assimp and stb for model loading.

The program takes a while to load, and only displays a black screen in the meantime. Be patient! (I should really add a loading screen).
